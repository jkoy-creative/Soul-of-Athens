              <p>It’s 8 p.m. on a Thursday evening and Evan Phillips is working on his motorcycle with his best friend Hunter Lyerla at the storage unit in Athens, Ohio. Many college students are typically on their way out to the lively uptown bars, or maybe an underground house show as Athens Ohio University  is known for its nighttime party scenes.</p>
              <p>Phillips’ Thursday night is far from that. He chooses to not join the crowd because he does not enjoy the crowded bar scene. He would rather drink beer at home with his roommates or work on his motorcycle.</p>
              <p>He stands beside his best friend, Lyerla, but knows he cannot open up to him about his personal struggles; he feels trapped. He is stuck right in the middle of the dark and isolated unit. This is not an unfamiliar feeling for Phillips. He has found himself once again unable to confide in someone he considers to be a close friend. He’s aching on the inside, because there is so much he wants to say but he knows he cannot cross that boundary. He’s worried that Lyerla won’t understand him because opening up about insecurities is unorthodox — it’s something that men just don’t do. He feels safer this way because it’s how he’s been conditioned to act his entire life.  Lyerla and Phillips go home after working for a few hours on the motorcycles. Lyerla goes to bed and Phillips heads to his own room, but it’s one of those nights that Phillips cannot fall asleep. He lies in bed staring at the ceiling, tossing from side to side.</p>

              <p> His mind is racing with uncontrollable thoughts about his past relationships, school, work, regrets and everything in between. He hasn’t been drinking, but his mind staggers between those thoughts like a drunk wandering around aimlessly. He finally grabs his phone and starts to watch “Hand Tools Rescue,” a YouTube channel about restoring old tools.</p>
              <p>“You just hear the tap of a hammer or something similar,” Phillips says. “It helps that there is no dialogue so then you don’t have to focus on anything. I think old tools are pretty neat. It’s nice to see old rusty things getting restored, it calms me down.”</p>
              <p> He watches the channel for a few hours and desperately hopes that it will work. After three hours Phillips’ mind is still racing, and he cannot get himself to shut his eyes and let his mind stop thinking. It’s 12 a.m., and Phillips is still restless, he decides to go on a drive.</p>
              <p>He gets into his 2002 manual Lexus IS300 and heads toward the Marathon gas station on Stimson Ave. to fill up his gas tank for the drive. He gets on State Route 690 in Athens toward State Route 550 until he arrives in Bartlett. That is tonight’s route.</p>
              <p>“This car ride is not for the faint of heart,” Phillips says.</p>
              <p>It is not an easy drive by any means; there are many narrow and sharp turns. On one of his previous rides he completely lost control of the steering wheel and almost crashed. But Phillips loves driving this route because it gives him something else to focus on. He doesn’t even play music because he wants to stay in the moment of just focusing on driving the narrow, dark turns.</p>
              <p>The narrower the roads, the more excited Phillips becomes. His heart rate goes up, and he can almost hear his heart beating through his chest. Every time he changes gears the smirk on his face broadens. All he wants is to hear the sound of the engine revving up as he shifts gear.</p>

              <p>There is nowhere else in the world that he would rather be. Just him, the road and the steering wheel.</p>
              <p>Phillips goes for night drives when he feels stressed out or when something significant happens in his life and he needs to process it.</p>
              <p>“Driving definitely calms me down,” Phillips says. “When I get on the 555 road it’s very twisty, so it forces you to pay attention so it’s a lot easier for me to just focus on that instead of whatever I have going on in my life. It’s a good time to think and process stuff too because you don’t have anything else going on at that moment. It’s just you and the steering wheel.”</p>
              <p>Phillips is now on the home stretch. He finally makes it to U.S. 50 West, on the way back to Athens. The roads aren’t narrow or sharp anymore, so he uses this time to agonize about mistakes he made in his past. </p>
              <p>“I ruminate on stuff that happened in the past just like everybody does, but I tend to focus a little bit more on things that I wish I should have done differently, things I should probably leave in the past, whether it was relationships, things I did or things I said,” Phillips says. “That is just always something that is on my mind. Whether it’s good or bad, but typically it’s bad.”</p>
              <p>Phillips finally makes it back home at a little after 2 a.m. He tries to be very quiet because his roommates are all asleep. He tiptoes back to his room and he’s finally at a little more ease. Exhausted, he shuts his eyes knowing he has to be up in four and a half hours to get ready for his 8.30 a.m. guitar class.</p>

                <p>Phillips has been struggling with mental health issues since the summer between graduating high school and going to college. He was first diagnosed with general depression and that was the first time he went to seek professional treatment. </p>
                <p>“A lot of people were telling me you’re nervous because you’re leaving home, but I knew that was not it, it has been something I have been struggling with in my own head for a while,” Phillips says.</p>
                <p>Phillips was working at Panera Bread that summer when he realized it was time to seek professional help.</p>
                <p>“That was the point where I was having a complete mental breakdown for an entire week and that is when I knew I needed to get help, it was tough to overcome at first.”</p>
                <p>As the years went on, Phillips saw many specialists who have diagnosed him with several different mental health issues. The last specialist he had diagnosed him with a form of depression called dysthymia. This means that Phillips always feels like a 3/10 every day with low energy and a lack of sleep. Phillips has had serious insomnia since he was in middle school and it has only has gotten worse with the stress of college. He also has general anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).</p>
                <p>The 40 years of research done by the American Psychological Association (APA) proves that Phillips’ mental health issues stems from traditional masculinity ideology. According to the APA, men represent 77 percent of homicide victims and commit 90 percent of homicides in the United States. Men are most at risk of being victimized by violent crime. Men are also 3.5 times more likely than women to die by suicide, and their life expectancy is 4.9 years shorter than women’s. All of the above numbers are directly correlated to cultural masculinity norms-how they are supposed to think, feel and act.</p>
                <p>An expert in the field of psychology, specifically focusing on masculinity ideology, Dr. Ronald F. Levant has been studying the psychology of gender for 40 years. Levant was the 2005 president of the American Psychological Association and the first president of the Society for the Psychological Study of Men and Masculinity (APA Division 51), serving as co-founder of the Division and co-chair of the committee that founded it.</p>
                <p>Levant argues that there are ways of looking at gender and masculinity: one way is to think that masculinity is biologically based, meaning hormones and genes govern how men stereotypically think, feel and behave. Another view is that gender (masculinity/femininity) is socially constructed and psychologically based.</p>
                <p>Levant says that he has evidence that the psychological and social effects are stronger than the biological effects.</p>
