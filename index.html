          <div class="bodyText">
              <p>Under the buzzing sound of the flickering fluorescent light, Evan Phillips and Hunter Lyerla are repairing the carburetor on Evan’s 1982 Honda Nighthawk in the storage unit that is as dark as midnight. Even though Evan is standing within an inch of his best friend he still feels detached from Hunter. Many college students his age are on their way out to the lively bars, walking under street lights and past loud music, or maybe an underground house show as Athens is known for its nighttime party scenes. Evan’s Thursday night is far from that, preferring quiet and isolation, avoiding the crowd. </p>

              <p id="vertBike">As Evan works beside Hunter he feels trapped, emotionally stuck. This is not unfamiliar. Once again, he is unable to confide in a close friend. He’s aching on the inside, because there is so much he wants to say, but he cannot cross that boundary. He’s worried that Hunter won’t understand him because Evan was raised to ignore insecurities — it’s something that men just don’t talk about. He feels safer this way because it’s how he’s been conditioned to act his entire life — to be a man.</p>

              <p>A few hours later, Evan stares at the ceiling, tossing from side to side. His mind races with uncontrollable thoughts about his past relationships, school, work, regrets and everything in between. He hasn’t been drinking, but his mind stumbles between those thoughts like the students who stumble from bar to bar wandering around aimlessly on Court Street. He finally grabs his phone and starts to watch “Hand Tools Rescue,” a YouTube channel about restoring old tools. </p>

              <p id="vertHand horizWrench">“You just hear the tap of a hammer or something similar,” Evan says. “It helps that there is no dialogue so then you don’t have to focus on anything. I think old tools are pretty neat. It’s nice to see old rusty things getting restored, it calms me down.”</p>

              <p>He desperately hopes that the channel will tire him out. After three hours Evan’s mind is still racing, and he cannot get himself to shut his eyes.</p>

              <p>It’s 12 a.m. He bounces off of his bed, puts on his grey hoodie and sweatpants and hops into his 2002 manual Lexus IS300. He heads toward the Marathon gas station on Stimson Ave. to fill up his gas tank. He yanks the stick from first to third gear as he gets on State Route 690 and heads toward State Route 550 until he arrives in Bartlett. That is tonight’s route.</p>

              <p>“This car ride is not for the faint of heart,” Evan says.</p>

              <p>His seat belt tightens up on his chest as he swiftly exists the highway and downshifts from fifth to third gear to prepare for the turns. This route makes him forget about everything for a little while. It forces him to stay in the moment by navigating the narrow dark turns.</p>

              <p id="landscapeRed">The infamous 555 route also known as the “triple nickel,” is famous for its narrow turns and rolling hills — a bikers heaven.</p>

              <p>The tighter the roads, the deeper the focus. Every time he changes gears, his smirk broadens. The engine revs up as he shifts gears, and the tires squeal during the tight turns. There is nowhere else in the world that he would rather be.</p>

              <p id="driveDetail">“When I get on the 555 road it’s very twisty, so it forces you to pay attention so it’s a lot easier for me to just focus on that instead of whatever I have going on in my life,” Evan says. “It’s just you and the steering wheel.”</p>

              <p>Evan is now on the home stretch — U.S. 50 West. The open clear road allows more space for Evan to agonize about mistakes he made in his past.</p>

              <p>“I ruminate on stuff that happened in the past just like everybody does, but I tend to focus a little bit more on things that I wish I should have done differently, things I should probably leave in the past, whether it was relationships, things I did or things I said,” Evan says. “That is just always something that is on my mind. Whether it’s good or bad, but typically it’s bad.”</p>

              <p class="finalParagraph">At 2 a.m Evan tiptoes back to his room and braces the door as it clicks shut. He’s finally at a little more ease as he fumbles into his bed. Exhausted, he shuts his eyes knowing he has to be up in four and a half hours for his 8.30 a.m. guitar class.</p>

          <p>Evan has been struggling with mental health issues since the summer between graduating high school and going to college.</p>

          <p id="horizNeighborhood singleHouse">“A lot of people were telling me you’re nervous because you’re leaving home, but I knew that was not it, it has been something I have been struggling with in my own head for a while,” Evan says.</p>

          <p>During that summer, Evan was working 50 hours a week at Panera Bread with his shifts starting daily at 5 a.m. and ending around 3 p.m.</p>

          <p>“This was hard for an 18-year old boy who was trying to prepare for college. That was the point where I spiraled into a week-long breakdown and that is when I knew I needed to get help; it was tough to overcome that at first.”</p>

          <p>Evan essentially stopped eating, he would not feel hungry for days at a time and lost a lot of weight quickly. He would oftentimes lay in bed until he had to get up for work without having slept at all. From Tuesday night to Friday morning he slept a total of two hours.</p>

          <p>“I was exhausted, but for some reason I could not fall asleep, no matter what I tried. I was going through a lot at that time with personal relationships and what not, so I have to assume that contributed somewhat to my issues, but I don't believe it was the sole cause,” Evan says. “At the end of this week, I started to just crash, both emotionally and physically, and ended up sleeping in my car on Friday morning when I got to work, only to be woken up by my manager tapping on my window after my shift had started.”</p>

          <p>Evan managed to make it through the day but as soon as his shift was over, he went straight home afterwards and slept for about 6 hours, the most he has gotten in weeks.</p>

          <p>“After this, I approached my parents and told them I think I fit the symptoms of depression and they helped me schedule an appointment with my doctor, who recommended me to a few different therapists, as well as prescribing me with some antidepressants and recommending some over the counter medication to help me sleep,” Evan says. “I still look at that week as the point where my mental health started declining and what, for lack of a better phrase, got me to the point of where my mental state is right now.”</p>

          <p>As the years went on, Evan saw many specialists who have diagnosed him with several different mental health issues. The last specialist he had diagnosed him with a form of depression called dysthymia, which means that Evan feels like a 3/10 every day with low energy and a lack of sleep. Evan has had trouble sleeping since he was ten years old but started having serious insomnia since he was in high school. His insomnia has gotten worse with the stress of college. He also has general anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).</p>

          <p> “A lot of people take it as me being mellow or laid back, but I just don't have the energy to get excited about stuff,” Evan says. “When you think of OCD you think of someone who has to turn the light switch on and off 20 times, but I am not quite that bad, I just can’t make eye contact with people. I tend to look at the bridge of people’s nose.”</p>

          <p id="portraitEyeContact">Evan says it makes a lot of people uncomfortable when he tells them that he cannot make eye contact with them.</p>

          <p class="removeLater">Transition to Levant with Data Section.</p>

          <p>The 40 years of research done by the American Psychological Association (APA) proves that Evan’s mental health issues stems from traditional masculinity ideology. According to APA, men represent 77 percent of homicide victims and commit 90 percent of homicides in the United States. Men are most at risk of being victimized by violent crime. Men are 3.5 times more likely than women to die by suicide, and their life expectancy is 4.9 years shorter than women’s. All of the above numbers are directly correlated to how men are supposed to think, feel and act.</p>

      <div class="bodyText">

          <p>An expert in the field of psychology, specifically focusing on masculinity ideology, Dr. Ronald F. Levant has been studying the psychology of gender for 40 years. Levant was the 2005 president of the APA and the first president of the Society for the Psychological Study of Men and Masculinity (APA Division 51), serving as co-founder of the Division and co-chair of the committee that founded it.</p>

          <p>Levant argues that there are two ways of looking at gender and masculinity: one way is to think that masculinity is biologically based, meaning hormones and genes govern how men stereotypically think, feel and behave. Another view is that gender (masculinity/femininity) is socially constructed and psychologically based.</p>

          <p>Levant says that he has evidence that the psychological and social effects are stronger than the biological effects.</p>

          <p>Levant argues that U. S. men live five years less than U. S. women and men have higher morbidity rates than women in terms of cancer, cardiovascular disease, unintentional injuries, infectious disease, particularly HIV aids and a few others as well. Further, there is evidence that men’s behavior accounts for the longevity and morbidity differences that men are gaged in their thirties.</p>

          <p>For example, Evan goes on speedy late-night drives by himself on extremely narrow roads to avoid thinking about his troubles.</p>

          <p>Evan has tried numerous types of medications to help with his anxiety and depression, one of them was Zoloft, an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) antidepressant prescribed for the treatment of depression, social anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). He was on it for many years.</p>

          <p id="pills">“It was the only one that I have taken so far that didn’t have any negative side effects for me. It worked for a little while and then one day it kind of stopped working,” Evan says.</p>

          <p>Even though Zoloft worked for a little bit, he still needed something that would help him sleep. His therapist at the time prescribed him with Ambien, which is a medication that treats insomnia in adults. </p>

          <p>“It’s highly addictive, so people end up using it recreationally,” Evan says. “If you take it and try to stay awake through it, it’s basically like getting blackout drunk except you have to have fine motor skills and it’s just a recipe for disaster.”</p>

          <p>It immediately put Evan to sleep the first time he took it, he did eventually start to use it recreationally, but he does not anymore.</p>

          <p>“Controllable behaviors that put one’s health at risk are in fact one of the ways that men demonstrate their masculinity,” Levant says.</p>

          <p>According to Levant examples of controllable behaviors include physical inactivity, poor diet and nutrition, tobacco use, substance abuse, irresponsible risky sexual behavior, risk behavior for preventable injuries and violence.</p>

          <!-- Suicide Attempt -->
          <p id="screenPortrait">In Jan., 2018 Evan overdosed on Ambien and alcohol. He was home alone that night, his only roommate was at his parents’ house for the weekend</p>

          <p>“It had been a shitty couple of months for me leading up to that point, and I was in a mental state that can only be described as ‘broken.’" Evan says. “I was running on 0-2 hours of sleep each night, having auditory hallucinations where I hear people call my name when I was home alone and hear screams that sounded like they were right next to me and I was even having false memories that oftentimes made no sense at all.”</p>

          <p>For a week or so leading up to that night he had been taking well above his prescribed dose of Ambien nightly. Evan was talking to his friend at the time via Facetime from before he had taken the Ambien until around the end of the night. At first, he took about 20 mg, he was prescribed 5 mg a night.</p>

          <p>“One problem with Ambien is that people often tend to take more once they're under the influence if they're using it recreationally, and I was no stranger to doing that, however on this night I ended up taking 80 mg on top of the 20 mg I had already taken, according to my friend’s recollection,” Evan says.</p>

          <p>He was now on 20 times his prescribed dosage and decided that he was going to drink half a bottle of Seagram’s Gin, which he can no longer look at anymore, as well to see if he would just pass out and not wake up, Evan decided to end his life that night.</p>

          <p>“I laid in my bed, still on Facetime with my friend, and at this point she had no idea what I was doing. I just seemed like my normal self even after I took 20 mg or so, I just didn’t seem any different,” Evan says.</p>

          <p>However, 10 minutes after he drank the gin things started to take a different turn.</p>

          <p>“I remember this part clearly, I felt my insides start to burn, my heart rate increased dramatically and I started to sweat profusely. I grabbed the trash can next to my bed and started to vomit blood and alcohol,” Evan says. “I remember thinking between breaths, ‘I'm going to die like this, alone in my room and my roommate is going to find me here in a few days.’”</p>

          <p>Evan realized immediately as he was throwing up that this wasn’t how he wanted to die.</p>

          <p>“I thought of my family, all of my friends and everyone who would be affected by this. I realized in that moment that, even though I didn't want to be alive, this isn't how I wanted to die. It was much too gruesome and, to be very blunt, left too much of a mess that I didn't want someone to have to deal with,” Evan says.</p>

          <p>Evan didn’t want his roommate to have to walk in and find him lying on the ground dead with his blood and vomit in the trash can next to him.</p>

          <p> “It was unfair to him and I could never imagine putting anyone through that,” Evan says.</p>

          <p>He hung up the phone with his friend and sat on the edge of his bed staring at the blood and vomit in the trash can. He couldn’t believe what he has done, what his life has come to. In that moment, despite what he was feeling, despite not wanting to be alive, he found the strength to get up and get rid of the trash can.</p>

          <p>“I stood up, walked out to the porch that my room was connected to and dumped the trash can into the bushes. I left it there and I actually left it there when I moved out as I couldn't stand the thought of having to pick it up and remember what I had done,” Evan says. “I walked back inside, and just sat in silence until I managed to pass out, all the while thinking I was still going to die, but too scared to call 911. I don't know why it didn't kill me that night, even though I've heard stories of people with worse fates who have overdosed on taking less.”</p>

          <p>Evan had been thinking about his suicide attempt for a while, he knew that his roommate would be out of town during that week so he knew that night would be the perfect time to do it.</p>

          <p>Substance abuse, in Evan’s case, overdosing on alcohol and Ambien, as described by Levant, is a way for men to demonstrate their masculinity. They are the ones who are in control of the situation. Evan’s suicide attempt was way for him to solve the problem, his mental health struggles. Evan thought it was his only way out.</p>

          <p id="doubleExposure"> Levant describes traditional masculinity ideology as beliefs that are shared broadly in U.S. society by people of all genders about how boys and men should think, feel and behave.</p>

          <p class="changeLater">“Masculinity ideology is associated with a whole host of harmful outcomes. We have been doing research in this area for over four decades and we have a journal that has been publishing since 2000 titled Psychology of Men and Masculinity,” Levant says.</p>

          <p>“There are thousands of studies that show correlation or links between various traditional masculinity constructs and either a positive correlation with a negative outcome or a negative correlation with a positive outcome,” Levant says.</p>

          <p>Levant says that traditional masculinity ideology exists in the culture which people believe to varying extents has been defined to consist of seven norms. They are norms that guide boys’ and men’s thoughts, feelings and actions.</p>

          <p>The seven norms are: Avoidance of femininity, negativity toward sexual minorities, self-reliance through mechanical skills (formerly self-reliance), toughness (formerly aggression), dominance, importance of sex (formerly nonrelational attitudes toward sexuality) and restrictive emotionality.</p>

          <p>Levant argues that traditional masculinity ideology is a problem because most men, and especially boys, are made to feel that it’s obligatory when they are growing up. Parents, particularly fathers, and certainly peers and friends, demand that they have to exhibit masculine traits. </p>

          <p>“I personally think a lot of men like to be stoic. I think there is a stigma behind it, that its more masculine to not show emotion. My parents raised me to be stoic. My dad is a very stoic man. I have seen him cry twice in my life and that is about the extent of his emotions,” Evan says. “I don’t think they directly ask me to be a stoic person, but I think they expect that. I don’t think they do it consciously. I was just raised around stoic parents and then it kind of translated to me.”</p>

        <div class="bodyText">
          <p id="polaroid">Evan has always found it difficult to discuss his feelings openly even with his family and close friends. He believes that this has to do with the stigma that men are not supposed to portray any emotions.</p>
          <p>According to Levant, boys who do not conform to masculine norms get bullied, beaten and harassed.</p>
          <p> “Boys who are not tough and dominant and who show their emotions or cry, who exhibit any behavior that is considered feminine, get harassed in school,” Levant says. “They get talked to by their parents, and parents tell them things like, ‘big boys don’t cry’ or ‘c’mon, man up’ or ‘if you don’t stop crying, I’ll give you something to cry about.’”</p>
          <p>The problem with forcing them to conform to traditional masculine norm is the damage that it inflicts on boys. Levant believes that most men by the time they have reached adulthood realize that these norms are impossible, that they are not workable and that they don’t meet them.</p>
          <p>“They accept that, and they come to terms with who they are just like most adults might have had the masculinity ideology instilled in them as children and how they should be and then they realize as an adult they are not that way,” Levant says. “They realize they are human; they are fallible, they are not perfect and they know that people may not agree with some of those norms, but most healthy adults say, ‘OK. I am who I am, and that is OK.’”</p>
          <p>Levant also argues that the lack of easy access to mental health care facilities in Ohio could be a contributing factor to why men do not seek mental health treatment. But he believes that men’s endorsement of traditional masculinity ideology is a stronger factor because some men tend to have very negative attitudes about seeking mental health treatment.</p>
          <p>“Seeking mental health care violates traditional masculinity norms of self-reliance,” Levant says. “Men are not supposed to be vulnerable. The lack of access is indeed a problem because even though these masculine norms interfere with men’s ability to access mental health care, when men get desperate enough or when their families get desperate enough, they will try to access it. If they can’t because they don’t have enough access or because places don’t take Medicaid then obviously that’s going to be a big problem as well,” Levant says.</p>
          <p>  Evan does not travel long distance anymore to seek mental health treatment, but it took him three years to find a specialist that he feels comfortable with in Athens. During his first three years of college, he would go to Columbus every other week to seek help.</p>
